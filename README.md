# HW2-Simple-Python-Server
Summary

In class we built a simple socket interface. We set up a socket server, and had a client connect and communicate with the server. In this exercise we will extend the socket server and create a very basic HTTP server.

Purpose:

To understand basic communication details at the point of the HTTP server Build a proper HTTP response


Deliverables

Run the server as it is and notice what is written to the command window as you click on the links. What is going on here? (Short paragraph or two.)
Build a simple 3-5 page website.
Interlink the pages so you can navigate between all of them.
Include some (at least 2) images, at least one GIF and one JPG. Change the server code to enable you to
render GIFs in your web pages
render JPGs in your web pages
allow the default request (http://localhost:9000/) return index.html
With images working on your pages, note what is happening in the command window as you click from page to page.
Submit the file as a pull request to the original project.
